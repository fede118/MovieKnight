# MovieKnight
Android app which provides now playing and coming soon movies to theaters

It consumes IMDB public Api -> https://imdb-api.com/

It uses MVVM pattern with HILT for DI and Coroutines for async api calls :D

And ROOM to save movies locally for 1 hour :D you can always swipe to refresh to force the api call ðŸ˜‰

I also use a visual component -> RecyclerComponent from my own components library https://github.com/fede118/components
